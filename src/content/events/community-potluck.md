## Monthly Community Potluck

One of our favorite traditions at NBCC is our monthly community potluck. After our Sunday morning service on the first Sunday of each month, we gather in the Fellowship Hall to share a meal together.

## What to Bring

- **Main Dish**: Casseroles, slow cooker meals, or other hearty dishes
- **Side Dish**: Salads, vegetables, or bread
- **Dessert**: Something sweet to finish the meal
- **Drinks**: We provide coffee, tea, and water

Please bring enough to serve 8-10 people, and remember to bring serving utensils for your dish.

## Why We Gather

Breaking bread together is a biblical practice that strengthens our bonds as a church family. It's a wonderful opportunity to:

- Get to know fellow church members
- Welcome visitors and new members
- Share life together beyond Sunday morning
- Build lasting friendships

## Visitors Welcome

If you're visiting NBCC, please join us! Don't worry about bringing a dish your first time - we always have plenty to share.
