## About Our Prayer Group

Every Wednesday at 7:00 PM, our church family gathers for a dedicated time of prayer. This is a relaxed, welcoming environment where we:

- Share prayer requests and praises
- Pray for our church, community, and world
- Encourage one another in faith
- Study scripture together

Whether you're new to prayer or have been praying for years, you'll find a warm welcome here. There's no pressure to pray out loud if you're not comfortable doing so.

## What to Expect

Our prayer time typically lasts about an hour. We begin with a brief devotional, move into sharing prayer requests, and then spend time in both corporate and individual prayer.

Feel free to arrive a few minutes early for fellowship and refreshments.
