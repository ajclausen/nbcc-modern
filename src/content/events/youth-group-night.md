## NBCC Youth Group

Our youth group meets regularly for students in grades 6-12. It's a safe, fun environment where teens can:

- Build friendships with other Christian students
- Explore their faith and ask tough questions
- Have fun through games and activities
- Grow in their walk with Christ

## What Happens at Youth Group

Each meeting includes:

- **Games & Activities** - We start with something fun to help everyone connect
- **Worship** - We sing together and focus our hearts on God
- **Bible Study** - Relevant teaching that applies to teen life
- **Small Groups** - Time to discuss and share in smaller settings
- **Snacks** - Because teenagers are always hungry!

## For Parents

Youth group is a great complement to what you're teaching at home. Our volunteer leaders are committed to helping your teens grow in faith while having a great time.

Feel free to drop off your student or stick around and chat with other parents!
